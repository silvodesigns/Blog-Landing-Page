## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

(Still working on hover states and mobile version)

### Links


- Live Site URL: [Blogr Landing Page](https://silvodesigns.github.io/Blog-Landing-Page/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design
- [Less](http://lesscss.org/) - CSS Library


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development
I am thinking on developing this site further and moving beyond the requirements for the challenge. I want to add a form for log in and register;connect them to an actual SQL database using Node.js; user authentication and token. Also, the ability for users to actually write blog posts as going the extra mile and keep my skills sharp.

### Useful resources

- [CSS trikcs](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I contanstly refered to this site to make sure I was using up to date responsive syntax.
