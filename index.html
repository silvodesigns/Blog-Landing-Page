    <h2>Designed for the future</h2>

    <span class="title">Introducing an extensible editor</span>
    <p>Blogr features an exceedingly intuitive interface which lets you focus on one thing: creating content.
      The editor supports management of multiple blogs and allows easy manipulation of embeds such as images,
      videos, and Markdown. Extensibility with plugins and themes provide easy ways to add functionality or
      change the looks of a blog.</p>

    <span class="title">Robust content management</span>
    <p>Flexible content management enables users to easily move through posts. Increase the usability of your blog
      by adding customized categories, sections, format, or flow. With this functionality, youâ€™re in full control.</p>

      and works seamlessly with Google Analytics. The architecture is clean and is relatively easy to learn.</p>

    <span class="title">Powerful tooling</span>
    <p>Batteries included. We built a simple and straightforward CLI tool that makes customization and deployment a
